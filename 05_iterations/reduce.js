//ðŸ‘†in this we have created an array then used reduce on that array and stored it in 'myTotal' variable and simply wrote function and added accumulator + current value
// we have also mentioned 0 that means we are inilializing accumulator with 0 .then it will perfomerm acc+ val =0+1 then after that from next it will store the result of previous acc+curval in new acc

//in this we simply used arrow function and got the same result
